      "user_msg": "Find recent arXiv papers about \"federated learning\" and give a short 2-sentence summary.",
      "expected_text": "Recent federated learning research focuses on handling non-IID data and improving robustness and security (including defenses against adversarial and backdoor attacks), while also exploring decentralized and asynchronous training methods and server-free architectures. Additional work addresses interpretability, heterogeneous client environments, and extensions toward privacy-preserving or quantum federated optimizations.",
      "actual_text": "Summary:\nThis collection of documents explores advancements and challenges in federated learning, a privacy-preserving machine learning approach. Document 1 surveys security aspects of combining federated and transfer learning, while Document 2 introduces VAFL, an asynchronous vertical federated learning method that enhances privacy and communication efficiency. Document 3 proposes a central server-free federated learning algorithm, OPS, designed for scenarios without a central authority and with unidirectional trust relationships, like social networks.\n\nHere are the papers with links:\n1. Federated and Transfer Learning: A Survey on Adversaries and Defense Mechanisms \u2014 https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.02337v1\n2.
